# Tools
- Phillips screwdriver (tightens leg screws)
- Power drill (optional for faster assembly)
- Furniture pads (optional for floor protection)

# Tool reasons
## Phillips screwdriver
Used for leg screws; tighten evenly to keep the top flat.

# Preparation
1. Turn the tabletop upside down on a soft surface.
2. Thread each leg by hand to avoid cross-threading.

# Assembly steps
1. Tighten leg screws in a cross pattern.
2. If using a drill, set low torque to avoid stripping.
3. Add furniture pads before flipping the table upright.

# Safety notes
- Do not overtighten screws; stop when snug.
- Keep the table level to avoid wobble.
