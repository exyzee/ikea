# Wall mounting
1. Find two stud locations that align with the top rail; mark pilot points.
2. Drill 3mm pilots into studs; for masonry, use rated anchors.
3. Fix brackets to the frame first, then to the wall, keeping the wardrobe level.
4. If studs are offset, use the strap diagonally but keep it flat and untwisted.
5. Re-check plumb after anchoring and before adding doors.

# Safety notes
- Anchor before loading shelves or doors.
- Stop if the wall feels hollow; confirm the anchor type.
