# Tools
- Allen key (5mm) (tightens frame bolts)
- Small wrench (secures nuts)
- Rubber mallet (optional for seating joints)

# Tool reasons
## Allen key (5mm)
Used to tighten frame bolts evenly without stressing the bentwood.

## Small wrench
Holds nuts in place while bolts are tightened.

# Preparation
1. Assemble on a soft surface to protect the wood finish.
2. Align left and right runners before tightening.

# Assembly steps
1. Attach the seat frame to side runners with bolts and nuts.
2. Tighten bolts gradually, alternating sides to avoid twist.
3. Seat arm joints with a rubber mallet if needed.

# Safety notes
- Re-tighten after first use to remove initial flex.
- Do not force joints with metal tools.
