# Wall mounting
1. Find a stud with the stud finder; mark a pilot point near the top rail.
2. Pre-drill a 3mm pilot hole; avoid cam bolts behind the panel.
3. Attach the safety bracket to the frame, then to the stud.
4. For masonry walls, swap in masonry anchors rated for the load.
5. Re-check level before loading shelves.

# Safety notes
- Do not use drywall anchors for tall storage without a stud.
- Stop if the wall crumbles; switch to the correct anchor type.
