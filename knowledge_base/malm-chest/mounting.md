# Wall mounting
1. Locate a stud or masonry point at the top rail height.
2. Pre-drill a pilot: 3mm for wood studs, masonry bit for brick/concrete.
3. Install the strap bracket to the frame with supplied screws.
4. Fix the strap to the wall anchor; remove slack without over-tensioning.
5. Re-check drawer slide alignment after anchoring.

# Safety notes
- Anchor the chest before loading the top drawers.
- Use the included strap rather than improvised hardware.
