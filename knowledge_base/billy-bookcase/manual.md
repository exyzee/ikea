# Tools
- Phillips screwdriver (fastens frame screws and shelves)
- Hammer (taps dowels and back nails)
- Allen key (5mm) (tightens cam bolts)
- Stud finder (recommended for wall anchoring)
- Level (recommended to keep the frame plumb)

# Tool reasons
## Phillips screwdriver
Used for frame screws, shelf supports, and the safety strap bracket.

## Hammer
Used to seat dowels and nail the back panel to keep the frame square.

## Allen key (5mm)
Used to tighten cam bolts without stripping particleboard edges.

# Preparation
1. Lay panels on a soft surface and group hardware by label.
2. Confirm the parts list matches the manual before assembly.
3. Keep the back panel flat to avoid bends.

# Assembly steps
1. Insert dowels, then connect side panels to the top and bottom.
2. Tighten cams by hand, then a quarter turn with the Allen key.
3. Slide the back panel in; nail every 15 cm to prevent racking.
4. Stand the unit upright; re-check cam tightness.

# Safety notes
- Keep the frame square before loading shelves.
- Always anchor tall furniture to the wall before loading heavy items.
