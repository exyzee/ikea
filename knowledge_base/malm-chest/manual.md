# Tools
- Phillips screwdriver (fastens drawer and frame screws)
- Hammer (taps dowels and back nails)
- Allen key (4mm) (tightens cam bolts)
- Power drill (optional for pilot holes)
- Furniture strap kit (optional for anchoring)

# Tool reasons
## Phillips screwdriver
Used for drawer fronts, rails, and frame screws.

## Hammer
Used to seat dowels without damaging the edges.

## Allen key (4mm)
Used to tighten cam bolts for a snug, square frame.

# Preparation
1. Assemble drawers first and keep left/right rails paired.
2. Check that drawer bottoms sit fully in grooves.
3. Keep the frame flat until all cams are engaged.

# Assembly steps
1. Connect side panels to top and bottom with dowels and cams.
2. Tighten cams gradually in alternating corners.
3. Install runners and drawer stops before inserting drawers.
4. Stand the chest upright and check that drawers glide evenly.

# Safety notes
- Anchor the chest once it is level to prevent tip-over.
- Avoid overtightening cams; stop when resistance increases.
